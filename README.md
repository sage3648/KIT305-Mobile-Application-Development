# KIT305-Mobile-Application-Development
My completed assignment work for KIT305, a mobile application programming unit at the University of Tasmania in 2018.

I have decided not to include the project files because the software is owned by the University of Tasmania. 

The link below is a video I created for the project and discusses the software features and design philosphy.
